This repository contains the projects which are given as the task during my internship at OASIS INFOBYTE.
This Project is done through machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. I used the machine learning algorithms that are some types of subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.

Algorithm used for prediction and accuracy are -
1.Decision tree classifier
2.K nearest classifier
3.SVM
4.Logistic Regression metrics

This project focuses on accuracy and prediction through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understandable for machine learning staters.

Project name: IRIS flower classification
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
Programming Language: Python
